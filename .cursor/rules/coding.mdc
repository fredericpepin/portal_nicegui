# Coding Guidelines for AI Assistants

**Primary Reference**: @CONTRIBUTING.md

## AI-Specific Notes

- Never overwrite .env files without explicit confirmation
- When making changes, always check for existing similar functionality in the codebase to avoid duplication
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones unless absolutely necessary
- For files over 200-300 lines, suggest refactoring opportunities
- When fixing bugs, exhaust existing implementation options before introducing new patterns

## Formatting

We use [autopep8](https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8) with a 89 character line length to format our code.

## Style Principles

- Always prefer simple solutions
- Avoid having files over 200-300 lines of code. Refactor at that point
- Use single quotes for strings in Python, double quotes in JavaScript
- Use f-strings wherever possible for better readability (except in performance-critical sections which should be marked with "NOTE:" comments)
- Follow autopep8 formatting with 89 character line length
- Each sentence in documentation should be on a new line
- Use ruff for linting and code checks

## Workflow Guidelines

- Always simplify the implementation as much as possible:
  - Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality
  - Remove obsolete code
  - Ensure the code is not too complicated
  - Strive to have minimal maintenance burden and self explanatory code without the need of additional comments
- Be careful to only make changes that are requested or are well understood and related to the change being requested
- When fixing an issue or bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation. And if you finally do this, make sure to remove the old implementation afterwards so we don't have duplicate logic
- Keep the codebase very clean and organized
- Write tests for new features
- Run tests before submitting any changes
- Format code using autopep8 before submitting changes
- Use pre-commit hooks to ensure coding style compliance
- When adding new features, include corresponding tests
- For documentation, ensure each sentence is on a new line
